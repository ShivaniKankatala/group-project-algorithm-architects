I think you could have put quite a bit more into this proposal; first, per the instructions and syllabus, I do not accept Word documents - only markdown.  Second, you don't have a link to your data so I have no idea what you're working with.  If it's the kaggle dataset, that's probably not really enough - the kaggle dataset does not contain sufficient demographic information to support anything particular novel or interesting.  Risks like "...historical credit data may reflect past economic inequalities, which can lead to biased predictions if not carefully evaluated. Models trained on such data may disproportionately affect certain demographic groups." cannot be addressed.

In the end, this would really be little more than a hyperparameter tuning exercise, and that's not enough for a semester long project. 

So, supposing you continue with credit risk assessment and find better data (I don't know of any).  You might push this further by trying to think more deeply about your stakeholder; pick one stakeholder, and think about problem you are trying to solve.  How does your analysis help?  How would it be used?  Is there an opportunity to be *creative* here?  

For example - for a general lender at a mid-size bank... Sure, providing a estimate of default likelihood is nice, but the bank already has it's own models, and they're probably pretty darn good.  But what if the lender wants to support, say, lower income individuals without well-established credit histories?  Or build more creative lending strategies to reduce defaults to help teach people how to be more responsible?  Or intervene *before* a default is likely to happen? These are more creative applications that would drive somewhat different approaches.

Please send me an updated proposal by next Weds.  Please use markdown.
